    "Now the canvas is set up such that there is a bird, target and ground on it. The functions can now be run such that the objects move in the ways calculated in the functions. In the projectile() function it was defined that if the target was toppled the function would return 1, and if it was either hit and not toppled or not hit at all it would return 0, therefore all we need to constrain here is that whilst x is still equal to 0 the animation (loops) carry on, and if not, they stop.
