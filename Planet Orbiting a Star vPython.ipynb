The system shows that since the masses of the planets much smaller than the mass of the central star, they only change each others orbits slightly, and the main ellipse shape of orbits with the star in the middle stays mostly the same. The largest interaction between planets can be observed when they are very close, they speed up dramatically causing them to follow a slightly different path on the next orbit. "
